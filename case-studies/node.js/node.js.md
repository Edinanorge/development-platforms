# Wellcome to the exciting word of Node.js!

## Hvat is Node.js?

Node.js is a powerful runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Since its creation by Ryan Dahl in 2009, Node.js has revolutionized server-side development, allowing developers to build scalable and high-performance applications using JavaScript, a language traditionally limited to client-side interactions in web browsers.

With Node.js, developers can utilize the same language for both front-end and back-end development, streamlining the development process and fostering code reuse. Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture enables efficient handling of asynchronous operations, making it particularly suitable for building real-time applications and APIs that require concurrent handling of many connections.

In this case study, we will explore the history, main features, market comparison, getting started guide, and future prospects of Node.js. We will also compare Node.js with other server-side technologies to understand its advantages and limitations in the evolving landscape of web development.
